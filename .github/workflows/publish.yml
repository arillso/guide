name: Deploy Documentation to GitHub Pages
# A descriptive name for the GitHub Actions workflow, indicating its purpose: deploying documentation to GitHub Pages.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    # Triggers the workflow on any push to the 'main' branch, ensuring that changes to the primary branch initiate the deployment process.

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 12 * * 5" # Every Friday at 12:00 PM UTC
    # Sets a scheduled trigger, running the workflow at a specific time regardless of code changes.
    # The cron syntax '0 12 * * 5' means the workflow runs every Friday at 12:00 PM UTC.

  pull_request_target:
    types: [closed]
    branches:
      - main
    # Activates the workflow when a pull request targeting the 'main' branch is closed.
    # The 'pull_request_target' event differs from 'pull_request' as it runs in the context of the base repository,
    # allowing workflows to safely use a write token when working with forked pull requests.

permissions:
  contents: read # Grants read access to the repository's content.
  pages: write # Provides write access to GitHub Pages for deployment.
  id-token: write # Enables the workflow to write ID tokens for authentication purposes.

concurrency:
  group: "pages" # Groups workflow runs in the 'pages' concurrency group.
  cancel-in-progress: false # Ensures that ongoing deployments aren't cancelled by new runs, maintaining deployment integrity.

  deploy-guide:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Utilizes the latest Ubuntu runner for job execution.
